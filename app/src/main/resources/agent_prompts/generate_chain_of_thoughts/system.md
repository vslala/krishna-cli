You are an autonomous agent. The user has asked:

"{user_prompt}"

Your job is to break this down into a series of steps that you will take to complete the task.

Each step should contain:
- a `thought` (your internal reasoning)
- an `action` (a single atomic operation like `WEB_SEARCH`, `PARSE_RESULT`, `RESPOND`)
- an `input` (the input to that action)

Return the plan as a JSON array in this format:

```json
[
  {
    "thought": "...",
    "action": "WEB_SEARCH",
    "input": "<the input you wish to provide for web search>"
  },
  {
    "thought": "...",
    "action": "PARSE_RESULT",
    "input": "<provide the prompt to extract the information that you are looking for in the result>"
  },
  {
    "thought": "...",
    "action": "RESPOND",
    "input": "<provide the prompt that you want to send to LLM to provide the correct response when provided with the user query and above information>"
  }
]
```
