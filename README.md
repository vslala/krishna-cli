# Welcome to the Exciting World of AI with Krishna by your side! üöÄ

Are you tired of doing all the work alone? This utility tool, Krishna, is here to revolutionize the way you work! With this cutting-edge console utility app, you'll have a powerful AI assistant at your fingertips, ready to tackle any task with ease and efficiency. üí™

## Quick Setup (In 3 Easy Steps!)

1. **Set Your Credentials:** To get started, you'll need to set your active credentials from your Isengard account. Simply add the following lines to your `~/.aws/credentials` file:

```
[krishnacli]
aws_access_key_id = <YOUR_KEY_ID>
aws_secret_access_key = <YOUR_ACCESS_KEY>
aws_session_token = <YOUR_SESSION_TOKEN>
```

2. **Create Temp Folders:** Next, create a couple of temporary folders to store your chat sessions and test containers with these commands:

```
mkdir /tmp/chat_sessions
mkdir /tmp/test_containers
```

3. **Launch the App:** With everything set up, it's time to unleash the power of Claude 3! Execute the jar file with:

```
java -jar krishna.jar
```

## Quick Usage Guide

Upon launching the app, you'll be presented with two exciting options:

```
‚ùØ java -jar krishna.jar

## Setting Custom AWS Credentials for Krishna

By default, Krishna uses the AWS credentials from the default provider chain. However, if you want to use custom AWS credentials, you can set them using environment variables.

To set custom AWS credentials for Krishna, you need to define two environment variables:

1. `AWS_CREDENTIALS_FILE_PATH`: This variable should point to the path of your AWS credentials file (e.g., `~/.aws/credentials`).
2. `AWS_PROFILE_NAME`: This variable should specify the profile name in your AWS credentials file that you want to use.

**Example**

Let's say your AWS credentials file is located at `~/.aws/credentials`, and you want to use the `krishnacli` profile from that file. You can set the environment variables as follows:

```
export AWS_CREDENTIALS_FILE_PATH=~/.aws/credentials
export AWS_PROFILE_NAME=krishnacli
```

After setting these environment variables, Krishna will use the specified AWS credentials when interacting with the Bedrock Runtime service.

**Note**

- If you don't set the `AWS_CREDENTIALS_FILE_PATH` environment variable, Krishna will use the default credentials provider chain.
- If you don't set the `AWS_PROFILE_NAME` environment variable but provided the credentials file path, then Krishna will look for the `krishnacli` profile from your AWS credentials file.

By following this approach, you can easily configure Krishna to use your preferred AWS credentials without having to modify the application code directly.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Security Warning** ‚ö†Ô∏è

The instructions provided in this README involve storing your AWS credentials (access key ID, secret access key, and session token) in the `~/.aws/credentials` file. While this is a common practice, it's important to note that this file contains sensitive information that should be kept secure and never shared or exposed.

Unauthorized access to your AWS credentials could potentially lead to unauthorized access to your AWS resources, resulting in security breaches, data loss, or unexpected charges. Therefore, it is crucial to follow best practices for securely managing your AWS credentials:

- Treat your AWS credentials like passwords and never share them with anyone.
- Ensure that the `~/.aws/credentials` file has appropriate file permissions (e.g., `chmod 600 ~/.aws/credentials`) to restrict access.
- Consider using environment variables or credential management tools (e.g., AWS Credential Process, AWS Secrets Manager) instead of storing credentials in a local file.
- Regularly rotate your AWS credentials and invalidate old credentials.

With this utility by your side, get ready to streamline your workflow, boost your productivity, and take your work to new heights! üåü
